# CS-255

The client for this project wanted a system to help them keep track of students and allow the students to schedule appointments and ask for help at any point. I think my implementation of this system was well-made and covered all the use cases that the client wanted. If anything, I'd like to go into more detail next time about certain aspects, as I gave a good overview but I'd like to go in more depth next time. That being said I looked through all the client's requests and made sure to implement them all. If I ever felt like we didn't have enough information then we bring that up with the client.
When I design software I make sure to know exactly what I want and plan it out accordingly. Implementation comes in last.
